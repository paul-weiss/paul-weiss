  ## Building the infrastructure for intelligence that can't be captured.

  The convergence is here: **AI models that prove their own correctness. Blockchains with quantum-resistant cryptography. Neural networks that learn on encrypted data.** This isn't science fiction—it's engineering problems waiting for
  builders.

  ### 🔐 Privacy-Preserving AI

  **Zero-knowledge machine learning** means models can demonstrate they were trained correctly without revealing training data or weights. **Federated learning** lets intelligence emerge across thousands of nodes without data ever
  leaving the edge. **Homomorphic encryption** makes "compute on ciphertext" not just possible, but practical.

  ### ⛓️ Cryptographic Infrastructure

  **Privacy-preserving blockchain infrastructure** using **threshold signature schemes** and **multi-party computation** eliminates trust assumptions. Cross-chain protocols where cryptography—not committees—validates state. Systems where
   mathematics proves correctness and privacy is a protocol guarantee.

  ### 🛡️ Post-Quantum Security

  **Post-quantum cryptography** isn't preparation anymore—it's deployment. Lattice-based schemes, hash-based signatures, code-based cryptography. Building systems today that remain secure when ECDSA breaks tomorrow.

  ## What excites me:

  - **Verifiable AI** where zero-knowledge proofs demonstrate model integrity
  - **Privacy-preserving computation** at scale—MPC, FHE, differential privacy in production
  - **Quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure** with forward secrecy baked in
  - Systems where decentralization is the architecture, not the marketing

  > **The future belongs to builders who understand that privacy isn't about hiding—it's about selective disclosure. That decentralization isn't about ideology—it's about eliminating single points of failure. That AI without 
  verifiability is just expensive autocomplete.**

  If you're building at this intersection—**verifiable AI, privacy tech, post-quantum systems**—I want to hear what you're working on. The hardest problems are the most interesting ones.
